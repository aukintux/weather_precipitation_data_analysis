# Weather Precipitaion Data Analysis Monteria, Colombia

This project is aimed to explore the weather precipitation data of Monteria, Colombia in order to estimate the dry and rainy season of the year as to know when it's better for farmers to plant their seeds and minimize the risk exposure that comes inherent with reling on weather factors such as rain. (Sun luminosity is not analyzed because in this particular location that is definitely not a problem. If you have ever been here you know that's true :)
